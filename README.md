# Cursor rules of @viclafouch 📦

This repository is the **source of truth** for my custom Cursor rules (`.mdc`). They define development standards, naming conventions, and best practices applied across all my projects.

## 🚀 Usage & Import

To import these rules into your project using the official Cursor method:

1. **Open Cursor Settings** → Go to **Rules, Commands**.
2. **Add Remote Rule**: Click the **+ Add Rule** button next to *Project Rules*, then select **Remote Rule (GitHub)**.
3. **Link Repository**: Paste the URL of this GitHub repository.
4. **Sync**: Cursor will automatically pull and sync the rules into your project.

> [!TIP]
> Imported rules stay synced with this repository. Any updates made here will be automatically reflected in your projects.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The rules are organized in the `.cursor/rules/` directory:

- `global.mdc`: Cross-cutting rules (naming, comments, etc.).
- `react.mdc`: Specific conventions for React development.
- `typescript.mdc`: TypeScript standards and type inference.
- `tailwind.mdc`: Best practices for styling with Tailwind CSS.
