# Overview

## Best practices
- Use English for the entire codebase (variable names, function names, file names, documentation like README.md, etc.), except for user-facing content which may be in other languages.
- Do not write comments. I don't need it.
- For boolean variable: It must follow the regex '^(is|has)[A-Z]([A-Za-z0-9]?)+'.
- For function that return boolean: It must follow the regex '^(matchIs|matchAs)[A-Z]([A-Za-z0-9]?)+'.
